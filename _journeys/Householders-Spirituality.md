<p><strong>Embarking on a spiritual journey, is full of questions. What is being spiritual ? How do I fulfill my role as householder and yet be spiritual ? How do the laws of karma impact us ? What is being ‘enlightened’ ? This learning journey is specially catered for those who want to harmonize their spirituals quests into their everyday lives. It is must for every householder, every parent, every spouse, every child, every boss, every employee.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bali - </strong>The Islands of the Gods - no wonder one sees aesthetic beauty merge with physical beauty throughout this island and in all aspects of life .  Also known as the “Morning of the World” one experiences a spiritual relationship between man, God and the environment- the Tri Hita Karana concept forms and integral part of the lives of the Balinese people. Enjoy the spirit of Bali as you discover yours with Divine Explorer.</p>
