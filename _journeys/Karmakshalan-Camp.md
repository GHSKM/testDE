<p>Seek blessings and make atonements for transgressions by bathing in waters of the Rameshwaran temple's sacred wells. After taking 3 dips  in the sanctified ocean, bathe in the 22 wells for spiritual cleansing and pay homage  at the Rameshwaram Temple Complex.  As the sacred waters are poured over you feel all the negativity which have held on to you being washed away, cleansed and released forever. A similar experience awaits you after a scenic trek in the forested hills as you stand under the purified and scented with over 4800 herbs, waters of the Kutrallam waterfalls. Have the privilege to mediate in the caves where the Great Siddhar Agastyar and Mahavatar Babaji meditated and experience the charged vibrations.</p>

<p><strong>Rameshwaran: </strong>As the legend goes, after killing Ravana Lord Rama victoriously returned with his consort Goddess Seetha to India first stepping on the shores of Rameswaram and worshipped Lord Shiva, to expiate the "dosha" of killing a brahmin. Thus the name Rameswaram.</p>
<p><strong>Kutrallam: </strong>Popularly know as the Spa of the South, the famous waterfalls of this area is known to have medicinal qualities. The water here passes over a lot of medicinal herbs, and is therefore known to have the capacity to cure a number of ailments.</p>
